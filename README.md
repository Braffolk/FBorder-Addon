# FBorder-Addon
Minecraft plugin [FactionsX](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/factionsx.83459/) addon that visualises faction borders using particles and colours them according to faction relations.

![faction with borders visualised](https://i.imgur.com/08Z9ndp.png "Example faction")
![nether faction with borders visualised](https://i.imgur.com/6XvebN9.png "nether faction")

The visualisation can be enabled by calling /f visualise-borders or /f v-b. The command also has a performance option

- /f visualise-borders Fast - fewer particles
- /f visualise-borders Normal - normal amount of particles
- /f visualise-borders Fancy - a lot of particles

Colors:
- green - ally or home faction
- blue - truce faction
- yellow - neutral faction
- red - enemy faction

## How to install
Get the plugin from [SavageLabs](https://savagelabs.net/store/FBorder-Addon) or from the [releases section](https://github.com/Braffolk/FBorder-Addon/releases).

Drop the .jar inside the `/plugins/FactionsX/addons` folder

## Ideas for improvement
